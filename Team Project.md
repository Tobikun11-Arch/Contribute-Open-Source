# Setting Up a Collaborative Repository with a Protected `main` Branch

## 1. Create a New Repository
First, create a new repository on GitHub.

## 2. Add Collaborators
Invite your team members to collaborate on the repository by going to the repositoryâ€™s **Settings** > **Manage access** and adding collaborators.

## 3. Create a `stage` Branch
In the terminal of your project, create a new branch called `stage` for staging changes:
```bash
git checkout -b stage
git push origin stage
