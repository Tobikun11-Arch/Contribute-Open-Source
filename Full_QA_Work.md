# QA Guidelines for Next.js MERN Stack - Stack Overflow Clone

## 1. Understanding Requirements
- **User Stories**: Understand the features like user registration, question posting, answering, voting, comments, and tag filtering.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Ensure that each feature has clear criteria for what is considered "done" or acceptable.

## 2. Test Planning
- **Test Strategy**: Define the types of testing (manual, automated, functional, non-functional).
- **Test Cases**: Write detailed test cases for user flows (e.g., posting a question, editing an answer, upvoting a response).
- **Test Environment**: Ensure the testing environment mirrors production for accurate results.

## 3. Functional Testing
- **Frontend Testing**: Focus on ensuring that the user interface works as intended across various devices and browsers.
  - **Input Validation**: Verify forms (e.g., posting a question or answer) have proper validation for text length, required fields, and invalid data.
  - **Navigation & Links**: Check if navigation between different pages works smoothly.
- **Backend Testing**: Ensure that the backend APIs (authentication, question CRUD operations, voting, etc.) work as expected.

## 4. Non-functional Testing
- **Performance Testing**: Test the app's ability to handle multiple users simultaneously (e.g., concurrent posts or votes).
- **Security Testing**: Ensure that user data is protected (e.g., no SQL injection, cross-site scripting, or data breaches).
- **Accessibility Testing**: Verify that the site is accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen readers).

## 5. Automation Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Ensure that individual components or functions (e.g., form validation) work correctly.
  - Use testing libraries like **Jest** for React components and **Mocha/Chai** for Node.js.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure different parts of the system work well together (e.g., frontend and backend communication).
- **E2E Testing**: Use tools like **Cypress** or **Playwright** to simulate a user interacting with the app from start to finish (e.g., posting a question, voting, and logging out).

## 6. Bug Reporting & Tracking
- **Bug Tracking**: Use tools like **Jira** or **GitHub Issues** to report and track bugs.
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure that existing functionality isnâ€™t broken whenever a bug is fixed or a feature is updated.

## 7. API Testing
- Use tools like **Postman** or **Insomnia** to manually test the APIs for user management, questions, answers, voting, etc.
- Check the correctness of responses, status codes, and payload structure for different use cases.

## 8. Collaboration with Developers
- Work closely with the development team to understand the technical architecture (e.g., MongoDB schema for questions, answers, and users).
- Participate in code reviews and provide feedback on test coverage, performance concerns, or potential user issues.
