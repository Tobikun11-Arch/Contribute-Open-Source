# QA Simple Flow

## Functional Testing
1. **Test Developer Branch**: 
   - Verify the responsiveness of the branch or feature developed.
   - Ensure that all elements display correctly across various screen sizes and devices.
   
2. **Create Improvement List**: 
   - Make a detailed list of UI/UX elements or features that need improvement based on responsiveness and functionality.

3. **Cursor Behavior**: 
   - Check if any characters or text elements display the incorrect cursor. 
   - Text elements should have the **default cursor**, not the **text cursor** unless it's an input or text area.

## Bug Tracking
- Use tools like **Jira** or **GitHub Issues** to report and track bugs.
- Perform **regression testing** to ensure no existing functionality is broken whenever a bug is fixed or a feature is updated.

## Soon-to-be Tests
- **Multiple Users**: Test if the website can handle multiple users logging in, registering, and posting simultaneously.
