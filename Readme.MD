# Fork and Cloning: A Guide to Contributing to Projects

Welcome to the **Fork and Cloning** repository! This project is designed to help you understand the difference between **forking** and **cloning** a repository, as well as when and how to use each method.

## Overview

### Forking
Forking is a powerful method to contribute to **open-source projects**. When you fork a repository, you create your own copy of it in your GitHub account. This allows you to:
- Work on an open-source project without affecting the original project.
- Propose changes via Pull Requests (PRs).
- Collaborate with others without needing direct access to the original repository.

### Cloning
Cloning is ideal when you have **write access** to a project. This process allows you to contribute code in a **staging** environment, where changes are reviewed before being merged into the main branch. In this workflow, there is a process of review and testing, ensuring that changes meet quality standards before integration. 

Cloning enables you to:
- Work in a dedicated branch (e.g., `stage`) that is used for development.
- Push updates to the project where changes are reviewed before they reach the main branch.
- Collaborate on projects with other team members, with the possibility of a code review or "interview" before merging.

## What You Will Learn

By working through this repository, you will gain the following knowledge:
- **How to Fork a Repository:** Learn how to create your own fork of an open-source project, work on it locally, and submit a Pull Request (PR) to the original project.
- **How to Clone a Repository:** Understand how to clone a project when you have write access, make changes in a development branch (such as `stage`), and push them back for review before merging into the main branch.
- **Contributing to Open-Source Projects:** Forking is essential when you want to contribute to open-source projects. You'll learn how to navigate the process of forking, making contributions, and submitting PRs to improve a project.
- **Contributing to Development Projects (Write Access):** Learn how to clone a repository with write access, contribute changes to the development branch, and push changes to be reviewed and merged into the main branch.

## When to Use Forking vs Cloning

| Contributing to an open-source project         | Fork    | You donâ€™t have direct access to the repository, but you can contribute by forking and submitting PRs. |
| Contributing to a project where you have write access | Clone   | You can clone the repository, work in the development branch (e.g., `stage`), and push your changes for review before they are merged into the main branch.
